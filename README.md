# node-lodex-update-model
Script to create a model from an older version of LODEX.

## Motivation
When you create a [LODEX](https://github.com/Inist-CNRS/lodex) instance for the
first time, you generally use AUTOGENERATE_URI (except when you already got
URIs). You create a model by picking columns in the original tabular data,
applying transformers or not.

When you want to update the LODEX version, you have to create a new instance,
using that new version of LODEX. You then have two options:

1. loading original tabular data again
2. exporting data from first LODEX instance, and loading it to the new one

Each option has its drawback:

1. You have to manage the URI, by no more auto-generating it. That means you
   have to modify the original data, by manually copy-pasting the generated URI
   into a new column.
2. You have to manually simplify the model:
   - no more auto-generate, simpling using a column value,
   - if you ignored original columns in the first LODEX instance, you'll have to
     point to the right column again, for each column.

This script will use the second option, to export the old model, modify it so
that the URI is no more autogenerated, and so that all columns point to the
right one.

## Usage

```bash
$ lodex-update-model model.json > new-model.json
```
